# SPIE2024-Geometry-Deformation-Lumbar-Spine-Segmentation
The source code and dataset of our SPIE 2024 paper: A Sequential Geometry Deformation Based Deep Learning Approach to Improve Accuracy and Consistence of Lumbar Spine MRI Image Segmentation.  

## Update
We have an advanced version of the work. Please move forward to [**this repository**](https://github.com/linchenq/TransDeformer-Mesh) or use this link https://github.com/linchenq/TransDeformer-Mesh.

Also, it's easier to re-run this [Colab Notebook Version](https://colab.research.google.com/github/linchenq/TransDeformer-Mesh/blob/main/infer_toy_colab.ipynb). This Colab allows you to edit the files from the repository directly in the Colab UI and annotates Colab cells that walk you through the code step by step. Below is the link for better visualization.
